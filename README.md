# Smart Reception

## Description
Smart reception is a face recognition application that allows the librarian to identify a student by providing powerful, easy to use student enrollment and identification screen. It allows the students to be enrolled into the system using their names and photos so that it can be used for the recognition later on. This allows the librarians to easily identify the enrolled members by their name once they stand in front of the reception.
